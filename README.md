_Component to integrate with [Hx 3 thermostats][hx3]._

![example][exampleimg]

## Installation

1. Using your tool of choice, open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `hx3`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/hx3/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Hx 3 Thermostat"

## Create new user token

Before you can use this integration, you'll need to have already setup the
Hx mobile app. Open the mobile app and navigate to... 
iOS: Settings->Multiple users.
Android: Settings->Manage account->Share account

Click the "Share code" button and copy the message that the app generates. It
should look something like this:

```text
I'm using the Hx Thermostat app to control our thermostat.
Once youâ€™ve downloaded the app, you can tap this link to share my account:
https://hx.kraftful.app/signIn/<email address>/<token>

Or you can use my email to sign in:
<email address>

And enter this code when prompted:
<token>

This code will only work for a week. Let me know if you want me to send a new one.
```

Make note of the `<email address>` and `<token>` from the text.
